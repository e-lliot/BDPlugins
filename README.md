## Downloading plugins
#### From this repo
You need to go to the `comiled` repo (you can do this by clicking on the button under the "Code" tab and selecting "compiled"). Then in there open the respective folder from the plugin that you wanna, and so click in the file that ends with `.plugin.js`. And to end, click in "Raw" and hit Ctrl + S (or command + s on mac), then choose BD's plugin folder

## Compiling
1- Change your BetterDiscord folder in `bdbuilder.config.json` (note: it is the BetterDiscord folder, not BetterDiscord's plugins folder)
2- [Follow BDBuilder's installation process](https://github.com/BetterDiscordBuilder/bdbuilder#installation)
3- Run `npm run build PluginName`
    - For watching changes, run `npm run watch PluginName`
